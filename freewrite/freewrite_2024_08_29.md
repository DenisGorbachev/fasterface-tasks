* The user wants to automate their workflows - so the automations themselves are more important than the interface
* The user must know that the automation exists before he could use it
* The user must know how to run the automation (what is the command name, what are the arguments) before he could use it
* The developers already use IDEs
* The developers already use terminals
* The developers have to switch between the terminals and the IDEs because the terminals provide a good UI for running arbitrary commands and the IDEs provide a good UI for editing the code
* The developer already has a context (e.g. an open file) when he decides to use the automation
* The developer can use both the Fasterface and the IDE simultaneously
